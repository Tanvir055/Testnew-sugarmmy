Certainly! If you're looking for a more comprehensive Python script with some functionality, here's an example of a basic "couple" program that takes user input for two names and prints a message:

```python
# couple.py

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Couple Program!")
    
    # Get names from the user
    name1 = input("Enter the first person's name: ")
    name2 = input("Enter the second person's name: ")
    
    # Print a message
    print(f"{name1} and {name2} make a great couple!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script prompts the user to enter the names of two people and then prints a message declaring them a great couple. You can run this script in a Python environment, and it will guide you through the process.

Feel free to specify if you have any particular functionality or requirements in mind for the "couple" program!
